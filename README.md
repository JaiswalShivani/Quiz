# Quiz
What is the description of a quiz? A quiz refers to a short test of knowledge, typically around 10 questions in length, with question formats often including multiple choice, fill in the blanks, true or false and short answer. A quiz is much shorter than a traditional test or exam and is rarely impactful on a final course grade.
